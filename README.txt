This is an admin application for the library study room reservation project.

This application was created using Python 3.6 and Tkinter.

The application serves as an Administrator interface for creating and modifying library room reservations.

Currently it is only a GUI and does not link to the room reservation database, but soon it will be integrated into a MongoDB database.
